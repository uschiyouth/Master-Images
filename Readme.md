# Master images
This is just a small program I wrote to analyze images for my master's thesis.
For this purpose, four images were taken at different coordinates. 
The program runs one image after another. It draws two equally spaced 
parallel lines horizontally and vertically across the image and draws a 
numbered circle at the intersection. The ground cover is to be determined 
at these intersections. These can be set to “dirt”, “rock”, “native vegetation” 
or “Phalaris” for each point using drop-down menus. The next image can only be
selected once all drop-down menus have been set. Once all 16 points or 4 
images per coordinate have been evaluated, the percentage of “dirt”, “rock”, “native vegetation”
or “Phalaris” in the ground cover at this coordinate is calculated and 
saved in an Excel file.
