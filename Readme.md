# Soil cover analyzer
During the monitoring of *Hogna ingens* (Lycosidae, Araneae) on the Island Deserta Grande on 100 coordinates, 
pictures of the soil cover were taken to be analyzed. This was done to determine, among other things,
how abundant the invasive Grass *Phalaris aquatica* is on the Island.

Each coordinate (plot) corresponds to 4 pictures. This tool loads the pictures and 
draws two horizontal and two vertical evenly spaced lines. A circle is drawn on the 
crossings of the lines. 

The soil cover on the crossing can be chosen in a dropdown. 
Possible values are "dirt", "rock", "native vegetation" and "Phalaris".

After all images of the corresponding plot are analysed, the relative amount
of each value is calculated in percent and writen to an Excel-file and the images 
of the next plot is shown.
